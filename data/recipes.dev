pork shoulder barbecue  <eos> Ingredients <eos> 2 tablespoons kosher salt <eos> 2 tablespoons granulated sugar <eos> one 5- to 6-pound pork shoulder , preferably with bone in and skin on ( ask for a "boston butt" ) <eos> 2 handfuls hickory chips ( other types of wood chips can be substituted ) <eos> 1 disposable aluminum foil shallow pan <eos> 1 smoker box ( see note ) <eos> 2 cups apple cider vinegar <eos> 1 cup water <eos> 1/4 cup packed brown sugar <eos> 2 3/4 teaspoons fine sea salt <eos> 4 teaspoons hot pepper flakes <eos> 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper <eos> Directions <eos> in a small bowl , mix the salt and sugar until combined . one to three days before you plan to grill , generously sprinkle the salt-sugar rub over the entire pork shoulder , covering every surface . you may not need the full ¼ cup of rub . ( a good rule of thumb is 2 teaspoons per pound of meat ) . if you're lucky enough to have a shoulder with skin on it , score the skin in a crosshatch pattern , leaving an inch or so between the lines . try to work some of the rub into the scorings . refrigerate the pork shoulder uncovered . bring to room temperature before you put it on the grill . <eos> prepare a gas grill for smoking . soak the wood chips in water for about 30 minutes ; set aside . on a section of the grill that won't receive direct heat , place a disposable pan or tray beneath the cooking grate and directly on the flavorizer bars or lava rocks ( whichever your grill has ) . fill the pan about halfway with water ; this will catch drippings and keep the inside of the grill moist . set the cooking grate back on the grill . adjust the burners so the temperature in the grill is somewhere between 200°f and 300°f . keep the burners under the drip pan off , and those not under it on . drain the wood chips and place them in a smoker box . a few minutes before putting the meat on the grill , set the smoker box directly over the heat source . ( smoke works best early in the cooking process ) . place the shoulder on the grill above the drip pan , skin or fat side up . <eos> cover the grill and roast the pork shoulder for 4 to 6 hours . the time it takes will vary depending on your piece of meat , the grill , and the cooking temperature . lower temperature is better but takes much longer to cook . whichever temperature you choose , check occasionally to make sure it does not exceed 300°f or fall below 200°f . when the temperature of the interior of the meat is 195°f , it should be done . don't be alarmed if the temperature of the pork shoulder rises quickly and then stays at 150° for a long time ( sometimes for several hours ) . this is called the "stall ." be patient and wait for it to reach 195°f . check to see if the meat feels relaxed to the touch or if you can pull it apart with a fork . if it resists , give it another 30 minutes . <eos> the meat should by now be a deep brown color . if the outside of the shoulder doesn't have some dark , crispy areas ( i .e . , bark or , if you started with the skin , crackling ) , crank up the temperature to 500°f for a few minutes . ( keep a close eye on it so it doesn't burn . ) remove the meat from the grill and let it rest for at least 20 to 30 minutes . <eos> combine the vinegar , water , sugar , salt , hot pepper flakes , and black pepper in a medium-size bowl and stir until the sugar and salt have dissolved ; set aside . <eos> either pull the pork shoulder apart with a fork or roughly chop with a cleaver , incorporating crispy bits of crackling ( if you have it ) or bark . mix in a generous splash of the vinegar bbq sauce ; adjust the seasoning , making sure there's enough acid ( vinegar ) and salt . put the remainder of the sauce in a pitcher on the table . serve with soft rolls . coleslaw and beans and rice make good accompaniments . <eos> Categories <eos> pork <eos> fourth of july <eos> father's day <eos> backyard bbq <eos> dinner <eos> summer <eos> family reunion <eos> grill/barbecue <eos>

sweet-and-sour balsamic-glazed spareribs  <eos> Ingredients <eos> 2 racks spareribs <eos> kosher salt <eos> 4 to 6 sprigs of fresh thyme <eos> 2 1/2 cups balsamic vinegar ( don't waste your best balsamic here ) <eos> 1/2 cup honey <eos> 2 cups ketchup <eos> 1 can beer ( preferably dry ) <eos> 1 tablespoon minced garlic <eos> 1 red onion , diced <eos> 1/2 cup dark brown sugar <eos> 1 tablespoon molasses <eos> 1/4 cup grainy mustard <eos> 1 or 2 teaspoons tabasco ( depending on how spicy you like it ) <eos> 1 tablespoon worcestershire sauce <eos> 1/2 cup water <eos> Directions <eos> preheat the oven to 250°f and place each rack of ribs on a square of aluminum foil . sprinkle the ribs generously with salt , add a few sprigs of thyme to each , and then wrap well . place the rib packets on a cookie sheet and bake for 3 to 4 hours , until the ribs are extremely tender . allow the ribs to cool slightly in their packets before opening . <eos> to make the glaze , combine all of the ingredients in a large pot on medium-low heat . allow to simmer , stirring every so often , for a few hours , until the sauce is nice and thick . set aside . <eos> to bring the ribs and glaze together , do the following . turn on the broiler ( if you don't have a broiler , get the oven up to 450°f ) . cut the rib racks into individual ribs , place them on a foil-lined cookie sheet or broiler tray , and brush them aggressively with the glaze . pop them under the broiler and watch them carefully : all that sugar makes them burn very easily! you want the glaze to fuse with the ribs ; it takes 3 to 4 minutes . if you're cooking the ribs in the oven , do so just until the glaze begins to bubble , 4 to 5 minutes . serve the ribs hot with lots of napkins—trust me , you'll need them . <eos> Categories <eos> pork <eos> bake <eos> broil <eos> dinner <eos> vinegar <eos> meat <eos> pork rib <eos> advance prep required <eos> dairy free <eos> peanut free <eos> tree nut free <eos> soy free <eos>

polenta with mushrooms  <eos> Ingredients <eos> 1/2 cup dried porcini mushrooms ( about 1/2 ounce ) <eos> 2 cups boiling water <eos> 1/4 cup olive oil <eos> 1 pound fresh button or cremini mushrooms , sliced <eos> salt and freshly ground black pepper <eos> 1/4 cup red wine <eos> 1 tablespoon minced garlic <eos> 1/2 cup chopped fresh parsley <eos> 1 cup medium or coarse polenta <eos> 1/2 cup milk , preferably whole <eos> 1 tablespoon butter <eos> 1/2 cup freshly grated parmesan cheese <eos> Directions <eos> put the dried mushrooms in a medium bowl and pour in the boiling water . press them down into the water now and then until they are soft , anywhere from 5 to 30 minutes depending on how dry they were . when it’s time to cook them , lift them out of the water with your hands or a slotted spoon and chop them roughly . reserve the soaking water . <eos> put the oil in a large skillet over medium heat . when it’s hot , add the soaked dried and fresh mushrooms and sprinkle with salt and pepper . cook , stirring occasionally , until the mushrooms are tender and have released all their liquid . 10 to 15 minutes . <eos> add the wine and let it bubble away for 1 minute , then stir in the garlic , 1/4 cup of the parsley , and 1 cup of the reserved soaking water . cook until the liquid thickens a bit , another 2 or 3 minutes , then taste , adjust the seasoning , and turn off the heat under the skillet . <eos> put the polenta in a medium pot with 1 cup water and whisk to form a smooth slurry . whisk in the milk and a pinch of salt and set the pot over medium-high heat . heat until the mixture boils then lower the heat to medium and cook , whisking frequently adding more water a little at a time to prevent lumps and keep the mixture somewhat soupy . expect to add another 2 1/2 to 3 1/2 cups of water before the polenta is ready . the polenta will be done in 15 to 30 minutes , depending on the grind . it will be thick and creamy , with just a little grittiness , and the mixture will pull away from the sides of the pan when you stir . when the polenta is done , turn the heat under the mushrooms to medium to warm them quickly . <eos> stir the butter and cheese into the polenta then taste and adjust the seasoning . serve the polenta topped with the mushrooms and garnished with the remaining 1/4 cup parsley . <eos> soaking dried mushrooms : the time needed to soften mushrooms depends on their size and age . they’re ready when you can cut one easily with a paring knife . you want to reserve the soaking liquid but leave the grit behind , so lift out the mushrooms rather than pouring to drain them . <eos> making the sauce : when the mushrooms are tender and the wine has bubbled away , stir in the garlic , parsley , and soaking water . <eos> making polenta by the slurry method : when the slurry just starts to boil , turn it down a bit so it bubbles gently . add more water or stir with a wooden spoon . <eos> recognizing doneness : when the polenta starts to pull away from the pan and is no longer gritty , it’s time to stir in the butter and parmesan . <eos> Categories <eos> mushroom <eos> hominy/cornmeal/masa <eos> dinner <eos> vegetarian <eos> parsley <eos> parmesan <eos>

or alternative <eos> 1/4 teaspoon smoked paprika <eos> 1 heaping teaspoon tomato paste <eos> generous 2 cups chicken stock <eos> 1 teaspoon red palm oil <eos> 1 1/4 cups white basmati rice <eos> Directions <eos> finely slice the peppers and onions . make a paste out of the garlic and 1 teaspoon of salt . seed and slice the scotch bonnet pepper , dice the tomatoes and set them aside . soften the onions and peppers in the sunflower oil over high heat for 5 minutes , stirring frequently . add the pasted garlic , scotch bonnet pepper , tomatoes , and dry seasonings and cook for another 10 minutes over medium heat , stirring frequently . add the tomato paste , cook for another minute or so , then remove from the heat . <eos> blend the mixture with a generous 3/4  cup of chicken stock . if this was prepared in advance , reheat it first . add another 3/4 cup of stock and blend until the mixture is smooth . add the palm oil , a final teaspoon of salt , and then pour 2 1/2 cups of this mixture back into the pot . heat the sauce until it is lightly bubbling . measure out your rice , then add to the pot . the pot should have a tight-fitting lid , but if it doesn’t you can use some foil with the shiny side facing down to retain the heat . stir gently so that all the rice is coated with the red sauce , then reduce the heat to a very low flame—the lowest possible . <eos> cover and simmer for 10 minutes . open the lid and stir gently again . it is important to get under the center of the pan so all the rice cooks at the same rate . cover and simmer for another 10 minutes . open and stir for a final time , then simmer for a final 10 minutes . this makes 30 minutes cooking time in total . turn the heat off and allow to steam , covered , for another 15 minutes . it’s tempting to open the pot here but it’s very important to trust the process and allow the rice to cook residually . this improves the final taste and texture of the rice . <eos> open the lid then leave to stand for 5 minutes , uncovered . then fluff with a fork to separate the rice , slowly working inward from the edge of the pan in a swirling motion . if the rice is not completely cooked , add the remaining 1/2  cup stock , stir gently , then place back over low heat for another 10 minutes . spoon the rice out onto a separate dish and serve . <eos> Categories <eos> harpercollins <eos> rice <eos> side <eos> chile pepper <eos> onion <eos> tomato <eos> spice <eos> dairy free <eos> wheat/gluten-free <eos> peanut free <eos> tree nut free <eos> soy free <eos> no sugar added <eos> kosher <eos>

grilled skirt steak tacos with roasted poblano rajas  <eos> Ingredients <eos> 2 medium white onions , sliced into 1/2-inch rounds ( keep the rounds intact for easy grilling ) <eos> 3 garlic cloves , peeled and roughly chopped <eos> 3 tablespoons fresh lime juice <eos> 1/4 teaspoon cumin , preferably freshly ground <eos> salt <eos> 1 pound beef skirt steak , trimmed of surface fat as well as the thin white membrane called "silverskin" <eos> vegetable or olive oil for brushing or spritzing the onions and meat <eos> a small bowlful of lime wedges for serving <eos> 12 warm , fresh corn tortillas ( see how to reheat corn tortillas  ) <eos> Directions <eos> 1 . marinating the meat . in a food processor or blender combine one-quarter of the onions , the garlic , lime juice , cumin and 1/2 teaspoon salt . process to a smooth puree . place the skirt steak in a nonaluminum baking dish . using a spoon , smear the marinade over both sides of the skirt steak . cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour or up to 8 hours . <eos> 2 . making the grilled chile-and-onion rajas . turn on the oven to its lowest setting . heat a gas grill to medium high or light a charcoal fire and let it burn just until the coals are covered with gray ash and very hot . either turn the burner( s ) in the center of the grill to medium-low or bank the coals to the sides of the grill for indirect cooking . set the cooking grate in place , cover the grill and let the grate heat up , 5 minutes or so . <eos> lay the chiles on the hottest part of the grill , and cook , turning occasionally until the skin is blistered and uniformly blackened all over , about 5 minutes . be careful not to char the flesh , only the skin . remove the chiles from the grill and cover with a kitchen towel . <eos> while the chiles are roasting , brush or spray the remaining onion slice with oil and lay the whole rounds of onions on the grill in a cooler spot than you chose for the chiles . when they're starting to soften and are browned on the first side , about 10 minutes , use a spatula to flip them and brown the other side . transfer to an ovenproof serving dish and separate the rings ( if they haven't started separating during grilling ) . <eos> 3 . grilling the meat . remove the steak from the marinade and gently shake off the excess . oil the steak well on both sides and lay it over the hottest part of the grill . grill , turning once , until richly browned and done to your liking , about 1 1/2 to 2 minutes per side for medium-rare ( the way i like skirt steak ) . <eos> 4 . serving the tacos . cut the long piece of skirt steak into 3-to 4-inch lengths , then cut each section across the grain ( that is , in line with the full length of the steak ) into thin strips . mix with the chiles and onions , season with a little salt and set on the table along with the lime wedges and hot tortillas , for your guests to make into soft tacos . <eos> working ahead : thin steaks like skirt taste best with a relatively short tour in the marinade — 1 to 8 hours . leave them longer , and the marinade overpowers the flavor and saps the rosy color of the meat . the poblano-and-onion rajas can be made several hours ahead and left at room temperature ; rewarm before serving . the steak , of course , must be grilled just before you're ready to eat . <eos> Categories <eos> beef <eos> onion <eos> pepper <eos> lime <eos> fall <eos> grill/barbecue <eos>

( this cleans the bones and meat and reduces the impurities that can cloud the broth . ) when the water returns to a boil , reduce the heat to a simmer . skim the surface often to remove any foam and fat . add the charred ginger and onions , fish sauce and sugar . simmer until the beef chuck is tender , about 40 minutes . remove one piece and submerge in cool water for 10 minutes to prevent the meat from darkening and drying out . drain , then cut into thin slices and set aside . let the other piece of beef chuck continue to cook in the simmering broth . <eos> 2 . when the broth has been simmering for about 1 1/2 hours total , wrap the star anise and cloves in a spice bag ( or piece of cheesecloth ) and add to the broth . let infuse until the broth is fragrant , about 30 minutes . remove and discard both the spice bag and onions . add the salt and continue to simmer , skimming as necessary , until you're ready to assemble the dish . the broth needs to cook for at least 2 hours . ( the broth will taste salty but will be balanced once the noodles and accompaniments are added . ) leave the remaining chuck and bones to simmer in the pot while you assemble the bowls . <eos> 3 . to serve , place the cooked noodles in preheated bowls . ( if the noodles are not hot , reheat them in a microwave or dip them briefly in boiling water to prevent them from cooling down the soup . ) place a few slices of the beef chuck and the raw sirloin on the noodles . bring the broth to a rolling boil ; ladle about 2 to 3 cups into each bowl . the broth will cook the raw beef instantly . garnish with yellow onions , scallions and cilantro . serve immediately , inviting guests to garnish the bowls with bean sprouts , herbs , chilies , lime juice and black pepper . <eos> to char ginger , hold the piece with tongs directly over an open flame or place it directly on a medium-hot electric burner . while turning , char until the edges are slightly blackened and the ginger is fragrant , about 3 to 4 minutes . char the onions in the same way . peel and discard the blackened skins of the ginger and onions , then rinse and add to the broth . <eos> Categories <eos> soup/stew <eos> beef <eos> ginger <eos> onion <eos> stir-fry <eos> dinner <eos> lime <eos> hot pepper <eos> anise <eos> clove <eos> noodle <eos> cilantro <eos> dairy free <eos> wheat/gluten-free <eos> peanut free <eos> tree nut free <eos> soy free <eos>

pasta alla norma  <eos> Ingredients <eos> 2 large , firm eggplants <eos> extra-virgin olive oil <eos> 1 tablespoon dried oregano <eos> optional : 1 dried red chili , crumbled <eos> 4 cloves of garlic , peeled and finely sliced <eos> a large bunch of fresh basil , stems finely chopped , leaves reserved <eos> 1 teaspoon good herb or white wine vinegar <eos> 2 14-ounce cans of good-quality chopped plum tomatoes , or 2 cups passata <eos> sea salt and freshly ground black pepper <eos> 1 pound dried spaghetti <eos> 6 ounces salted ricotta , pecorino , or parmesan cheese , grated <eos> Directions <eos> first of all , get your nice firm eggplants and cut them into quarters lengthwise . if they've got seedy , fluffy centers , remove them and chuck them away . then cut the eggplants across the length , into finger-sized pieces . get a large nonstick pan nice and hot and add a little oil . fry the eggplants in two batches , adding a little extra oil if you need to . give the eggplants a toss so the oil coats every single piece and then sprinkle with some of the dried oregano—this will make them taste fantastic . using a pair of tongs , turn the pieces of eggplant until golden on all sides . remove to a plate and do the same with the second batch . <eos> when the eggplants are all cooked , add the first batch back to the pan—at this point i sometimes add a sneaky dried red chili . turn the heat down to medium and add a little oil , the garlic , and the basil stems . stir so everything gets evenly cooked , then add a swig of herb vinegar and the cans of tomatoes , which you can chop or whiz up . simmer for 10 to 15 minutes , then taste and correct the seasoning . tear up half the basil leaves , add to the sauce , and toss around . <eos> get your spaghetti into a pan of salted boiling water and cook according to the package instructions . when it's al dente , drain it in a colander , reserving a little of the cooking water , and put it back into the pan . add the norma sauce and a little of the reserved cooking water and toss together back on the heat . taste , and adjust the seasoning , then divide between your plates by twizzling the pasta into a ladle for each portion . any sauce left in the pan can be spooned over the top . sprinkle with the remaining basil , grated cheese , and oil . <eos> Categories <eos> cheese <eos> dairy <eos> pasta <eos> tomato <eos> vegetable <eos> fry <eos> vegetarian <eos> quick & easy <eos> dinner <eos> lunch <eos> eggplant <eos> fall <eos> gourmet <eos> pescatarian <eos> peanut free <eos> tree nut free <eos> soy free <eos> no sugar added <eos> kosher <eos>

homemade croutons  <eos> Ingredients <eos> 3 slices stale firm-textured white bread <eos> 1 tablespoon or more softened unsalted butter , or 1 1/2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil <eos> 1/4 teaspoon crushed garlic ( optional ) <eos> Directions <eos> preheat oven to 300°f . <eos> trim crusts from bread and discard . <eos> lightly butter both sides of each slice ( or , if you prefer , first blend butter with crushed garlic ) . i often substitute fruity extra-virgin olive oil for butter , sometimes plain , sometimes mixed with 1/4 teaspoon crushed garlic . because bread absorbs more oil than softened butter , 1 1/2 tablespoons oil is about right . <eos> cut each buttered slice into 1/3-inch cubes and spread in a single layer , not touching , on an ungreased large baking sheet . <eos> slide onto the middle oven shelf and toast about 15 minutes until pale tan . <eos> use croutons as the recipe directs . <eos> Categories <eos> bake <eos> gourmet <eos>

sweet potato–chickpea-quinoa burgers  <eos> Ingredients <eos> 1/3 cup quinoa <eos> 1 medium orange sweet potato ( 3/4 pound ) <eos> 1 1/2 cups cooked chickpeas or one 15-ounce can , rinsed and thoroughly drained <eos> 1 heaping tablespoon finely minced fresh ginger <eos> 1 teaspoon minced or crushed garlic <eos> 3 scallions ( whites plus light greens ) , cut into 1-inch pieces <eos> 3/4 teaspoon salt , or more to taste <eos> 2 teaspoons cumin seeds , lightly toasted <eos> 2-3 tablespoons fresh lemon juice , or to taste <eos> 6 tablespoons quinoa flour <eos> 1 cup green peas ( steamed fresh or defrosted frozen ) <eos> 1 cup unsalted peanuts , lightly toasted ( optional ) <eos> crushed red pepper <eos> about 2 tablespoons grapeseed or high-oleic safflower oil for frying <eos> nonstick cooking spray <eos> Directions <eos> 1 . combine the quinoa and 1/2 cup water in a very small saucepan with a lid . bring to a boil , cover the pot , and lower the heat to the slowest possible simmer , with a heat diffuser , if you have one , underneath . you'll have cooked quinoa in about 20 minutes . uncover , fluff with a fork , and set aside . <eos> 2 . meanwhile , cut the sweet potato into rounds about 1 1/2 inches thick and steam over or cook in boiling water until fork-soft , about 15 minutes . cool until comfortable to handle . strip off and discard the peels and transfer to a food processor . <eos> 3 . add the chickpeas , ginger , garlic , scallions , 3/4 teaspoon salt , cumin , and 2 tablespoons of the lemon juice to the sweet potato and process until reasonably blended . it doesn't need to be completely smooth . <eos> 4 . transfer the mixture to a bowl , then sprinkle in the cooked quinoa and the quinoa flour . stir until all the quinoa disappears into the mixture . gently fold in the green peas and peanuts , if using . taste to see if it needs more salt or lemon juice and add a few big pinches of crushed red pepper flakes to taste . <eos> 5 . place a medium skillet over medium heat for about a minute , then add a scant 1/2 tablespoon oil and swirl to coat the pan . heat for a little longer , until the oil is hot enough to instantly sizzle a dot of the sweet potato mixture . turn the heat to low . <eos> 6 . use a nonstick-sprayed 1/3-cup measure to scoop-shape the batter as uniformly as possible . carefully transfer as many burgers as will fit in a single layer to the hot , oiled pan , knocking the cup handle assertively against the side of the pan or using the back of a spoon to release the batter . smooth the top surface with a dinner knife , so the burgers will crisp evenly , and push in the sides to help them keep their shape as they cook . <eos> 7 . cook over low heat for 8 to 10 minutes , or until golden brown on the bottom . ( longer cooking is ok—just not hotter . the sugar content of sweet potatoes causes them to burn easily at higher temperatures . ) use a small spatula with a thin blade to carefully loosen each burger and flip it over , adding more oil as needed and pushing the burgers back into shape if they slump or break . <eos> 8 . cook on the second side for 8 to 10 minutes , or until the bottoms are nicely browned . continue to cook in batches until all the batter has been used . serve hot or warm . <eos> toasted peanuts on top * steamed peas on top * yogurt or raita * salsa verde * a drizzle of pomegranate molasses <eos> Categories <eos> vegetable <eos> vegetarian <eos> dinner <eos> quinoa <eos> root vegetable <eos> sweet potato/yam <eos> vegan <eos> party <eos> advance prep required <eos> pescatarian <eos> wheat/gluten-free <eos> tree nut free <eos> soy free <eos> no sugar added <eos> kosher <eos>

beef brisket with slow-roasted romano beans and black olive aïoli  <eos> Ingredients <eos> 6 pounds whole beef brisket , with 1/2-inch top layer of fat <eos> 3 tablespoons thyme leaves <eos> 2 fresh bay leaves , thinly sliced ( if only dried bay leaves are available , crumble them ) <eos> 10 cloves garlic , smashed <eos> 3 chiles de árbol , crumbled with your hands <eos> 1 tablespoon plus one teaspoon cracked black pepper <eos> 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil <eos> 1 cup diced onion <eos> 1/3 cup diced carrot <eos> 1/3 cup diced celery <eos> 1/4 cup balsamic vinegar <eos> 3 cups red wine <eos> 4 cups beef stock , or more if needed <eos> 1 recipe slow-roasted romano beans <eos> 1 recipe black olive aïoli <eos> kosher salt <eos> Directions <eos> place the brisket in a large , shallow dish , and rub the thyme , bay leaves , garlic , chiles , and cracked black pepper onto both sides of it , coating the meat well . cover , and refrigerate overnight . take the brisket out of the refrigerator 1 hour before cooking , to bring it to room temperature . after 30 minutes , season the meat with 2 tablespoons salt . <eos> preheat the oven to 325°f . <eos> heat a large , heavy-bottomed sauté pan over high heat for 2 minutes . add the olive oil , and wait for 1 minute . place the brisket in the pan ( reserving the garlic and chiles ) . sear the meat on both sides , about 8 minutes per side , until it's deep golden brown . you will need to sear a portion of the meat at a time , because the entire brisket probably won't fit in the pan . to do this , leave one end of the brisket hanging off the edge of the pan , and then move that end into the pan when the other part is well seared . once both sides are well browned , transfer the brisket to a large roasting pan that has a tight-fitting lid , or a dutch oven . <eos> return the brisket searing pan to the stove over medium-high heat , and add the onion , carrot , and celery . stir with a wooden spoon , scraping up all the crusty bits in the pan . cook for 6 to 8 minutes , until the vegetables just begin to caramelize , then add the reserved garlic and chiles , and cook for a few more minutes . <eos> turn off the heat ( so that the liquids won't evaporate immediately ) , and add the balsamic vinegar , then the wine . turn the heat back up to medium-high , and reduce the wine by a quarter . add the beef stock , and bring the stock to a boil over high heat . pour the hot stock over the meat , scraping any vegetables that have fallen on the brisket back into the liquid . the stock mixture should almost cover the brisket . cover the pan tightly with aluminum foil and a tight-fitting lid . braise in the oven for 5 to 6 hours . <eos> to check for doneness , carefully remove the lid and foil , watching out for the hot steam . test the meat by inserting a paring knife into it ; if the knife slides in easily , then the brisket is done . <eos> let the brisket cool in its juices for 30 minutes . carefully transfer it to a baking sheet , and chill completely . <eos> strain the braising juices into a saucepan , pressing down on the vegetables with a ladle to extract all the liquid . skim the fat from the braising juices , and chill . <eos> when you are ready to serve , preheat the oven to 400°f . <eos> cut the cold brisket against the grain into 1/4-inch-thick slices . lay the slices in two large roasting pans ( or equivalent ) . heat the braising juices , and pour some over the meat , just to cover . cook for about 20 minutes , until the meat is hot and caramelized and crispy on top . <eos> place the slow-roasted romano beans at the center of six large dinner plates , and arrange the brisket on top . drizzle some of the braising juices over the meat . dollop a generous tablespoon of the black olive aïoli over the meat , and pass the rest at the table . <eos> Categories <eos> bean <eos> beef <eos> braise <eos> christmas <eos> passover <eos> dinner <eos> meat <eos> brisket <eos> red wine <eos> fall <eos> winter <eos>

poached salmon  <eos> Ingredients <eos> Directions <eos> a poached salmon of anywhere from 8-25 pounds will poach perfectly and may be eaten hot or cold . <eos> if you do not have a large poissonière — and very few people do these days — you can find various types of vessels , including a baby's bathtub , which will do the job extremely well . <eos> you may poach the fish in salted water , or in a court bouillon made from water , white wine , herbs and seasonings to your taste . be certain you make enough bouillon to cover the fish well during cooking . <eos> wrap the fish in several thicknesses of cheese cloth , leaving long ends to hang over the edges of the fish cooker . bring the water or bouillon to a boil and lower the fish into it . if you have a rack that will fit in the pan and hold the fish , it is ideal . if not , you must be careful not to split the fish when removing it from the liquid . reduce the heat when you place the fish in the cooker so that you have what the french call a faible ebullition , and poach until a meat thermometer plunged into the thickest part of the fish registers 160°f . <eos> serve the poached salmon hot with lemon butter or with a bearnaise sauce or mustard hollandaise or a rich bechamel sauce to which you have added chopped hard-cooked eggs and parsley . <eos> or serve cold with a good homemade mayonnaise or mustard mayonnaise . allow 1/2 pound for each serving . <eos> beer or chilled wine — muscadet or a pinot chardonnay go well with salmon . cucumber salad and tiny new potatoes are extremely pleasant with it ( chopped chives and tarragon will give the potatoes a different flavor ) . <eos> Categories <eos> fish <eos> herb <eos> brunch <eos> poach <eos> buffet <eos> salmon <eos> white wine <eos> healthy <eos> house & garden <eos>

maine lobster bake  <eos> Ingredients <eos> 75 pounds rockweed <eos> 1 whole 6-pound fish ( striped bass , salmon , or bluefish , etc . ) , gutted and scaled <eos> 12 large red bliss or medium maine potatoes <eos> 6 medium sweet potatoes <eos> 2 pounds large white boiling onions or small spanish onions <eos> 4 jumbo sea clams ( optional ; used for flavoring , not eating ) <eos> 6 to 8 pounds soft-shell clams ( steamers ) <eos> 6 to 8 pounds mussels <eos> 4 pounds periwinkles <eos> 3 pounds linguica , chorizo or other sausage <eos> 12 live 1-pound chicken lobsters <eos> 16 ears sweet corn <eos> 12 extra-large eggs <eos> 2 pounds unsalted butter <eos> you will need a shovel , a broom , a large canvas tarp that is at least 8 x 6 feet , a couple of big buckets , a few pairs of tongs , two pairs of gloves to protect hands from the steam , a pot to melt butter , a ladle , cheesecloth for wrapping the small food items ( such as steamers and periwinkles ) , twine for tying the cheesecloth bundles and platters for the cooked food . a picnic table is terrific for serving the platters of food but is not absolutely necessary . you will also need plates , cups , bowls for melted butter , eating utensils , lobster crackers , plenty of napkins and several large garbage bags . <eos> Directions <eos> scout out the location well in advance . a rocky beach is superior for cooking , but a sandy beach is better for swimming . decide which will be more pleasurable for your guests . if you decide on a sandy beach , you will need quite a few large , flat rocks , so choose a spot where you will not have to spend hours dragging them in . if your beach does not have a lot of driftwood , you will need to bring about twenty fireplace-size logs . you will also need newspaper and kindling . organize your wood supply and set up the pit the day before the bake . bring along a tarp so that you can cover the wood and keep it dry overnight . make sure there is plenty of rockweed growing nearby ; otherwise , arrange for about seventy-five pounds of it . most lobster dealers have plenty on hand , but it is wise to order ahead of time . the small oval sacs on the rockweed release the seawater that is essential for creating steam inside the pit . take note of the foods growing near your location . if there are lots of mussels and periwinkles , count them as part of your ingredients , but be sure to check with the coast guard for "red tide alert ." you will have lots of time to pick them while you wait for your fire to be ready , provided you have a low tide at that time . if you intend to rake for clams , remember that you need a permit in most places . <eos> build your pit well above the high-tide line . i have heard disaster stories of waves crashing over the pit and ruining the bake . to cook enough food for twelve to sixteen people , the pit should be about 5 x 3 1/2 feet wide and 3 feet deep . <eos> i learned how to build a pit on a rocky beach from my friend john stevens — a lobsterman and great "bake master" from boothbay harbor , maine — when , about eight years ago , we filmed a lobster bake for a pbs series called "crazy for food ." you will not always be able to create a pit that is 3 feet deep on a rocky beach , but this is okay because the top of the pit does not have to be flush with the ground . find an area where the stones are less that 1 foot in average size and remove them from the center as you build up the sides . you may even find an area where nature has started the pit . if you clear 2 feet down and build 1 foot up , you will still have a pit that is 3 feet deep . be sure your tarp is big enough to fold over the sides of the pit and lay flush with the ground . one advantage of a pit built on a rocky beach is that it can reach a very high temperature and cook food more quickly than a pit built on a sandy beach . another advantage is that you will not get sand in your food . <eos> you will dig the pit 5 1/2 x 4 feet wide and 3 1/2 feet deep . line the bottom with large stones and the sides with smaller ones . after you add the rocks , the pit will be the same size as that built on a rocky beach . taper the sides of the pit toward the bottom so that the walls do not collapse . the more stones you use to line the pit , the better it will retain the heat . <eos> have the pit and firewood ready to go . about 3 1/2 hours before you start the lobster bake , stack the kindling in a tepeelike structure with crumpled newspaper underneath . light the fire ; once the kindling is burning well , begin to stoke the fire by adding more kindling , then small logs or driftwood . after they have caught fire , start adding the bigger logs or driftwood ; once they catch , use your shovel to spread them around the pit . continue stoking the fire with more logs until the entire pit is filled with blazing wood . after about 2 hours , when the fire has reached its hottest stage , quit stoking the fire ( do not add any more wood ) and allow the wood to burn away completely . this should take about 1 1/2 hours . wet your broom in the ocean and brush away all the coals and ashes ; they will settle between the hot rocks . <eos> 1 . prepare the pit according to the directions above . while the fire is cooking down , start preparing the food . scrub the potatoes and sweet potatoes in the nearby ocean . peel the onions , wrap in 4 cheesecloth sacks ( so you can have the aroma of onions scattered throughout the pit ) and tie the sacks off with twine . scrub the sea clams and return them to your cooler . wrap the steamers , mussels and periwinkles in cheesecloth sacks , putting about 2 pounds in each bundle . tie the bundles together and place temporarily in the ocean — just be sure they are well anchored . otherwise , return the bundles to the cooler to keep chilled . divide the sausage into portions . to prepare the corn , carefully pull back the husks without detaching them . pick away the silk and fold the husks back over the corn . wet the corn in the ocean a few minutes before you begin the bake . <eos> 2 . start the bake as soon as the coals have cooked down and been brushed away . at this point , a single person ( the bake master ) should take charge of the actual bake . that person should have an assistant . caution should be exercised around the pit : master and assistant should take their responsibilities seriously , and children should be kept at least 10 feet away . gather all the food and bring it close to the pit . make sure the rockweed is moist . if it is not , give it one last dip in the ocean and bring it close to the pit . bring the tarp to the ocean and soak it thoroughly . work carefully but as quickly as possible . <eos> 3 . start with an 8-inch layer of rockweed . place the whole fish in the center and lay the potatoes , sweet potatoes , onions and sea clams around the fish . cover the food completely with a 4-to 6-inch layer of rockweed and then distribute the bundles of steamers , mussels and periwinkles , with the sausages on top . add the third layer of rockweed ( 4 to 6 inches ) over the food . place the lobsters in the center , back to back ( actually tail to tail ) , forming 2 rows . lobsters can only move backward on land , so by laying them this way , they will stay put . place the corn around the lobsters and scatter the eggs about . place one egg very close to the corner of the pit and remember exactly where it is . scatter a last thin layer of rockweed over the corn and eggs but do not cover the lobsters . by now the steam will be rising from the pit fairly vigorously . cover the pit with the damp tarp and place heavy rocks all around to form a tight seal . place the butter in a pot and set it on a corner of the tarp to melt . <eos> 4 . if your pit is on a rocky beach the food could be ready in as little as 50 minutes , but an hour is the norm . if your pit was made in the sand , the food could take up to 90 minutes . make sure everyone knows the approximate time of unveiling . have all plates and utensils ready . bring the platters near the pit ; you can even warm them on the tarp . the bake master and assistant should have their gloves on for the next step . <eos> 5 . remember the special egg? lift up the corner of the tarp and pull out the egg . crack it open . if it is cooked through ( hard-boiled ) , the bake is ready to eat . gather everyone about 10 feet from the pit . remove the melted butter and all the rocks that are holding the tarp in place . the bake master should grab one corner and the assistant the other , on the side closest to the gathering of family and friends . quickly pull back the tarp . there will be a giant burst of steam . when it subsides , the bright red lobsters will come into view . both the bake master and the assistant will use tongs to remove the food and place it on platters . as the rockweed is removed , it should be spread around the outside of the pit to show that it is still hot . the hot pit cannot be left unattended — a child or dog could be injured . get a few people to bring buckets of water up from the beach to pour over the rocks to cool them . the others should unwrap the cheesecloth bundles , cut the potatoes in half and set out the food . put the butter in small bowls for dipping lobsters , steamers , mussels and anything else you want . allow plenty of time to eat before you bring out the desserts . <eos> 6 . after the festivities have ended , everyone should help clean up . cover the pit back up with rocks or sand ; be sure there are no hot rocks left on the beach . the rockweed can be left on the beach to decompose , but all other litter must be put in garbage bags and taken away . the beach must be left as it was found . <eos> Categories <eos> egg <eos> fish <eos> potato <eos> steam <eos> sausage <eos> clam <eos> lobster <eos> mussel <eos> corn <eos> summer <eos>

todd's modern day brisket  <eos> Ingredients <eos> 2 tablespoons salt <eos> 1 tablespoon smoked paprika <eos> 1 tablespoon mustard seed <eos> 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper <eos> one 3-pound beef brisket , trimmed of excess fat <eos> 2 tablespoons canola oil <eos> 2 sprigs fresh rosemary <eos> 2 sprigs fresh thyme <eos> 3 garlic cloves , crushed <eos> 1 carrot , chopped <eos> 2 celery rib , chopped <eos> 1 small onion , chopped <eos> 4 cups veal stock <eos> 2 cups dry red wine ( such as cabernet sauvignon ) <eos> 1/2 cup balsamic vinegar <eos> Directions <eos> brown the brisket . heat the oven to 325°f . mix together the salt , paprika , mustard seed , and pepper in a small bowl . rub the spice mixture all over the brisket . heat the oil in a large heavy skillet over medium-high heat . add the brisket and cook until brown on both sides , turning once—5 to 7 minutes per side . <eos> bake the brisket . transfer the brisket to a baking dish just large enough to hold it . then add the rosemary , thyme , and garlic . add the chopped vegetables and pour in the veal stock , wine , and vinegar . cover the dish with heavy-duty aluminum foil and bake until the brisket is fork-tender—3 to 4 hours . transfer the brisket temporarily to a plate while you strain the liquid through a mesh strainer into a small saucepan ( discard the herbs , vegetables , and garlic ) and wash and dry the baking dish . <eos> press the brisket . return the brisket to the clean baking dish . place another heavy dish on top of it , directly on the meat , to weight it down . the ideal weight for this is 2 . pounds , so add some canned goods to the top dish . then wrap the entire assemblage in foil ( over weights and all ) and refrigerate overnight and until shortly before ready to serve . <eos> make the sauce . meanwhile , heat the strained braising liquid over medium heat until it is reduced to about 2 . cups—about 20 minutes . the finished sauce should have a glaze-like consistency . taste the sauce and add salt or pepper if you wish . refrigerate the sauce until ready to reheat the brisket . <eos> complete the brisket . shortly before ready to serve , remove the brisket from refrigerator and transfer to a cutting board . also remove the sauce . cut the brisket into 3-inch cubes : you don't want to waste any of the meat , so the cubes don't need to be exactly this size or perfect along the edges . place the brisket in a pan just large enough to hold it in a single layer . pour in enough sauce to just cover the meat ( you may add a little stock or water if there isn't enough sauce to do this ) . heat over low heat until warmed through—about 10 minutes . spoon the brisket onto a serving platter ; pour the sauce over and serve . <eos> Categories <eos> wine <eos> beef <eos> bake <eos> passover <eos> meat <eos> brisket <eos> chill <eos> kosher for passover <eos> advance prep required <eos>

heaven-and-earth tempura cakes  <eos> Ingredients <eos> 1/2 red onion , cut into thin slices through the stem end to make crescent shapes ( about 1/3 cup ) <eos> 1 tablespoon cornstarch <eos> scant 1/3 cup julienne-cut carrot peels ( 1-inch strips ; about 3 ounces ) <eos> scant 1/3 cup julienne-cut japanese-style sweet potato or other sweet potato peels ( 1-inch strips ; about 2 1/2 ounces ) <eos> 3-ounce chunk bitter melon , cut in half lengthwise , seeds removed , very thinly sliced , salted with 1/4 teaspoon salt , and drained , about 1/4 cup <eos> 1 tablespoon cornstarch <eos> 2 small zucchini , about 4 ounces total weight , tops trimmed , cut in half lengthwise , and then cut on the diagonal into thin slices , about 2/3 cup <eos> scant 1/3 cup julienne-cut kabocha squash peels ( 3/4-inch strips ; about 3 ounces ) <eos> 2 tablespoons finely shredded summer herbs such as fresh shiso leaves <eos> 4 or 5 fresh chives , cut into 1/2-inch lengths <eos> several ice cubes <eos> 1/3 cup cold water <eos> 1/4 cup self-rising cake flour <eos> vegetable oil for deep-frying <eos> 1 to 2 teaspoons aromatic sesame oil ( optional ) <eos> 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt <eos> generous pinch of kona-zanshõ <eos> generous pinch of tõgarashi <eos> generous pinch of freshly ground black pepper <eos> lemon or lime wedges <eos> Directions <eos> depending upon seasonal availability , choose to make either the winter pancakes or the summer pancakes : to make the winter pancakes , place the red onion in a bowl . with a pastry brush , dust the slices thoroughly with some of the cornstarch . pull gently to separate the crescent shapes , dusting again with a bit more cornstarch . add the carrot and sweet potato peels to the bowl and dust with the remaining cornstarch . toss to distribute the vegetables evenly . <eos> to make the summer pancakes , with a pastry brush , dust the bitter melon slices thoroughly with some of the cornstarch , then place them in a bowl . dust the zucchini slices and kabocha peels in a similar manner and add them to the bowl ; toss to distribute evenly . dust the shredded shiso leaves and chives with cornstarch and add them to the bowl ; toss again to distribute evenly . <eos> make the batter just before frying : place the ice cubes in a small bowl with half of the water . sift the cake flour over the water and stir to mix slightly ; there should still be lumps . if needed , add water , a few drops at a time , until the batter is the consistency of a thin pancake batter . <eos> pour the vegetable oil to a depth of 1 1/2 inches into a small wok or small , deep skillet . add the sesame oil and heat slowly . check the temperature with an unvarnished long wooden chopstick ( or a bamboo skewer ) . small bubbles will form around the tip when the oil is about 350°f . wait for about 45 seconds longer to allow the temperature to rise a bit more—to about 370°f—and then test the oil temperature with a few drops of batter . if they sink slightly , then rise to the surface and puff quickly but do not color , the oil is ready . you may need to fry the pancakes in batches to avoid crowding them in the pan . preheat the oven to 200°f for keeping the cooked pancakes warm . <eos> spoon a bit of the batter over the cornstarch-dusted vegetables and toss lightly to coat the vegetables with the batter . dip a large spoon or ladle into the hot oil . place one-eighth of the vegetable mixture in the bowl of the oil-dipped spoon . carefully tilt the spoon to slide the pancake into the hot oil , aiming to make a disk about 2 inches in diameter . the batter and cornstarch act as "glue" to keep the vegetable slivers together . repeat to make more pancakes , being careful not to crowd the pan . <eos> most important , refrain from touching the pancakes for a full 30 seconds after you place them in the oil . it will seem like an eternity , but gaman will yield the best results . if wayward bits are strewn at the edges of your pan , carefully pick them up and place them on top of the still-moist pancake batter in the center . ( skill with long chopsticks will be well rewarded , though a long-handled fine-mesh skimmer can scoop beneath as well . ) if the center of the pancake is very dry , dip the wayward bits in some fresh batter before "gluing" them in place . when the batter in the center of the disk seems barely moist , carefully invert the pancake . <eos> after flipping , allow the pancakes to fry undisturbed for about 1 minute , or until crisp . using cooking chopsticks or a skimmer , remove the pancakes from the oil and place them on a rack set over a baking sheet to drain . if frying in batches , place the baking sheet in the oven to keep the fried pancakes warm . use the skimmer to clear the oil of batter bits between batches . <eos> when all of the pancakes are fried , transfer them to paper towels to absorb any additional surface oil . <eos> Categories <eos> onion <eos> appetizer <eos> vegetarian <eos> carrot <eos> squash <eos> zucchini <eos> vegan <eos> sugar conscious <eos> kidney friendly <eos> pescatarian <eos> dairy free <eos> peanut free <eos> tree nut free <eos> soy free <eos> no sugar added <eos> kosher <eos>

peach lattice pie with bourbon caramel  <eos> Ingredients <eos> 2 cups ( 400 g ) granulated sugar <eos> 3/4 cup ( 170 g ) unsalted butter <eos> 1 1/4 cups ( 295 g ) heavy cream , at room temperature <eos> 1 teaspoon kosher salt <eos> 3 teaspoons vanilla extract <eos> 2 tablespoons bourbon <eos> 1 recipe magpie dough for flaky piecrust , chilled overnight <eos> 2 pounds ( 907 g ) ripe peaches , each peeled , halved , pitted , and cut into 8 wedges <eos> 1/2 cup ( 96 g ) packed light brown sugar <eos> 1 tablespoon vanilla extract <eos> 1 tablespoon freshly squeezed lemon juice <eos> 1/2 cup ( 96 g ) granulated sugar <eos> 3 tablespoons finely ground instant tapioca ( ground using a spice grinder ) <eos> 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon <eos> 1/8 teaspoon fine salt <eos> 1 large egg yolk <eos> 2 tablespoons sanding sugar or coarse raw sugar , for sprinkling <eos> Directions <eos> pour the sugar into a medium high-sided saucepan , tilting the pan to distribute the sugar evenly across the bottom of the pan . set the pan over medium-high heat . use a rubber spatula to occasionally push the sugar from the outer edge of the pan toward the center . the sugar will clump up slightly , but just keep pushing it around a bit ; it will eventually smooth out . when the sugar is dissolved and darkened to the color of a copper penny ( about 5 to 7 minutes ) , add the butter and whisk until incorporated . be careful : the mixture will bubble up when you add the butter and might even seem like it’s about to overflow the pan ; just keep whisking and it will quickly settle back down . <eos> take the pan off the heat and carefully add the cream in two stages , whisking until smooth and incorporated . add the salt , vanilla , and bourbon , whisking to combine . <eos> pour the caramel through a fine-mesh strainer into a bowl and cool completely to room temperature , about 2 hours , before using or transferring to an airtight container to store in the refrigerator . return to room temperature before using . <eos> roll out one disc of magpie dough for flaky piecrust into a 13-inch circle with an even thickness of 1/4 inch . transfer dough to a 9-inch pie pan and trim overhang to 1 inch all the way around . cover the bottom crust with plastic wrap and put the pan in the refrigerator while you roll the dough to the top shell . <eos> roll out the second disk of pie dough to a 13-inch circle with an even thickness of 1/4 inch . transfer dough to a parchment-lined baking sheet and using a pizza wheel , pastry cutter , or large knife , along with a ruler , cut dough into ten 1-inch-wide strips . cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate while you work on the filling for the pie . <eos> preheat the oven to 400°f ( 200°c ) with a rack in the center . line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper . <eos> in a large bowl , toss the peaches with the brown sugar , vanilla extract , and lemon juice . let sit 5 minutes . <eos> in a small bowl , whisk together the granulated sugar , ground tapioca , cinnamon , and salt . sprinkle the sugar mixture over the peaches and toss to combine . the mixture may look dry at first ; let it sit at room temperature for 10 to 15 minutes to allow the sugar and lemon juice to draw more of the juices out of the fruit , then give it another good tossing to mix well and moisten all of the sugar and tapioca granules . <eos> retrieve the prepared crust from the refrigerator and set the pan on the parchment-lined baking sheet . pour the filling into the bottom shell . use your index finger to scrape some of the syrupy fruit juices off the sides of the mixing bowl and generously moisten the top edge of the shell . <eos> lay remaining dough strips on top of the pie in a lattice pattern , then roll and crimp the edges . <eos> whisk the egg yolk with 1 tablespoon water . lightly brush the lattice with the egg wash and sprinkle with sanding sugar . transfer the baking sheet to the oven and bake the pie 25 minutes , then rotate the baking sheet , lower the oven temperature to 350°f ( 175°c ) , and bake 30 minutes more , or until the juices bubble up through the lattice . tent the top with foil if the crust starts to over-brown . <eos> set the baking sheet on a wire rack and let the pie cool and set uncovered , at room temperature , overnight ( or up to 3 days ) before slicing and serving . serve with bourbon caramel sauce . <eos> Categories <eos> dessert <eos> pie <eos> bake <eos> peach <eos> bourbon <eos> whiskey <eos> tapioca <eos> butterscotch/caramel <eos> labor day <eos>

shredded sweet potato and carrot fritters (ukoy)  <eos> Ingredients <eos> 3 thai chiles , thinly sliced <eos> 1 garlic clove , finely chopped <eos> 2 tablespoons chopped red onion <eos> 1/4 cup sugarcane vinegar or distilled white vinegar <eos> kosher salt <eos> 1 medium sweet potato , peeled <eos> 4 medium carrots , peeled <eos> kosher salt <eos> 8 cups ( or more ) vegetable oil <eos> 3/4 cup ( or more ) club soda <eos> 1 teaspoon fish sauce <eos> 1 1/4 cups cornstarch <eos> 4 ounces small or medium shrimp , peeled , deveined <eos> 1 cup cilantro leaves with tender stems <eos> a deep-fry thermometer <eos> Directions <eos> mix chiles , garlic , onion , and vinegar in a small bowl ; season with salt . <eos> thinly slice sweet potatoes and carrots into 3x1/4" planks ( use a mandoline if you have one ) , then slice lengthwise into matchsticks . place in a medium bowl and toss with a few pinches of salt . let sit until slightly softened , about 30 minutes . rinse off salt and pat dry . <eos> pour oil into a large heavy pot to a depth of at least 2" but with at least a 4" headspace , as oil will bubble aggressively when you add fritters . fit pot with thermometer ; heat oil over medium-high until thermometer registers 330°f–340°f . <eos> meanwhile , combine club soda and fish sauce in a large measuring glass . add cornstarch and whisk until smooth . place half of sweet potato and carrot mixture , shrimp , and cilantro in a medium bowl and toss to combine . pour in half of cornstarch slurry and toss to coat ( slurry should cling to shrimp and vegetables in a light , even layer ) . <eos> using a slotted spoon , carefully lower half of slurry-coated vegetable and shrimp mixture into oil . once bubbling subsides , mixture will disperse across the surface of oil . using a spider or a clean slotted spoon , corral vegetables and shrimp by gathering them against the side of the pot until they form a large mound that clings together and can be turned as a single unit . fry , turning occasionally and increasing heat as needed to keep oil temperature between 330°f and 340°f , until fritter is golden brown and crisp around edges , about 4 minutes . transfer to a wire rack set inside a rimmed baking sheet . repeat process with remaining slurry-coated vegetable and shrimp mixture , adding a splash or so of club soda if needed to loosen batter ( it should look like a glossy coating ) , to make another fritter . <eos> repeat entire process with remaining sweet potato and carrot mixture , cilantro , shrimp , and cornstarch slurry to make 2 more fritters . <eos> season fritters lightly with salt . serve with chile vinegar alongside for dipping . <eos> chile vinegar can be made 3 days ahead . cover and chill .

seasonal country salad with spiced walnuts  <eos> Ingredients <eos> 2/3 cup sugar <eos> 1 tablespoon ground star anise <eos> 2 tablespoons ground coriander seed <eos> 1/2 teaspoon cayenne <eos> salt <eos> 2 cups shelled walnut halves <eos> 1 pound mixed lettuces , washed and dried <eos> 1/4 cup aged sherry-walnut vinaigrette <eos> Directions <eos> preheat oven to 350°f . in a medium bowl , stir together the sugar , spices , and salt . toast the walnuts lightly on a sheet pan in the oven , for about 4-5 minutes . while the nuts are toasting , heat the spiced sugar in a 10-inch skillet over medium heat . when the sugar just begins to melt around the edges , toss in the warm nuts , straight from the oven . shake the pan vigorously over the burner until all the nuts are coated in sugar — it will cling in somewhat uneven patches , but that is the effect i like . pour the nuts onto a plate or baking sheet to cool — don't be tempted to try one until they have really cooled down , since sugar at this temperature will give you a burned tongue to remember! <eos> toss the salad greens with the spiced walnuts and the vinaigrette and top with a generous slice of ham and 1 ounce of cheese per person , according to the seasons ( see weighing your options ) . <eos> spring : grilled asparagus with serrano ham and maytag blue cheese ( to grill asparagus , blanch the asparagus to halfway tender , brush with a little olive oil , season with salt and pepper , and grill until lightly brown ) <eos> summer : fresh black mission figs with smithfield ham and aged goat cheese <eos> fall : lightly roasted seckel pears with pecorino romano and prosciutto <eos> winter : blood oranges and fennel with feta and prosciutto <eos> Categories <eos> salad <eos> appetizer <eos> bake <eos> quick & easy <eos> walnut <eos> spring <eos> anise <eos> lettuce <eos> coriander <eos> kidney friendly <eos> vegan <eos> vegetarian <eos> pescatarian <eos> dairy free <eos> wheat/gluten-free <eos> peanut free <eos> soy free <eos> kosher <eos>

( you may need to lower the heat as the frying progresses . ) give the tofu one last flip on a paper towel to sop up any stray oil and reheat the sauce . <eos> serve with rice and broccoli , pouring sauce over all . <eos> Categories <eos> bean <eos> garlic <eos> ginger <eos> vegetarian <eos> tofu <eos> pan-fry <eos> gourmet <eos>

( you might want to use a little less dressing . ) instead of the parsley , use mint if you like . a handful of chopped almonds or pecans make a nice addition . <eos> tomato rice salad : use any kind of brown or white rice . when making the vinaigrette , eliminate the vinegar and add 1 medium tomato to the blender . instead of the scallion and other vegetables , add 2 cups chopped fresh tomato ( a mixture of heirloom varieties is nice ) .instead of the parsley , use chopped fresh basil or mint , or 1/4 cup chopped fresh chives , chervil , dill , or about a tablespoon of fresh thyme leaves . <eos> Categories <eos> rice <eos> salad <eos> potluck <eos> side <eos> citrus <eos> vegetarian <eos> vegan <eos> wheat/gluten-free <eos> tree nut free <eos> peanut free <eos>

tarte tatin  <eos> Ingredients <eos> 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour <eos> 1/4 teaspoon sea salt <eos> 7 tablespoons unsalted butter <eos> 5 to 6 tablespoons ice water <eos> 1 1/2 cups vanilla sugar <eos> 10 tablespoons unsalted butter , cut into thin slices <eos> 4-1/2 pounds apples ( try fuji , winesaps , northern spy , jonagold or even , in a pinch , golden delicious with a drizzle of lemon juice ) <eos> Directions <eos> line a baking sheet with parchment paper . roll out the pastry on a lightly floured work surface to form an 11 1/2 inch round . transfer the pastry on its baking sheet to the refrigerator for at least 1 hour . <eos> peel , halve , and core apples . spread the sugar evenly over the bottom of a 10-inch cast-iron , oven-proof skillet . place the butter slices evenly over the sugar , then arrange the apple halves on top of the butter . begin at the outside edge and stand the halves on their sides , facing in one direction with stem ends toward the center . pack the apples as close together as possible , gently pushing them together so they are held standing by pressure . make a second circle of apple halves inside the first , packing them in on their edges as well . place one apple half right in the center of the second circle to fill in the small space that remains . the idea is to get as many apples into the pan as possible , while keeping them nicely arranged . <eos> place the skillet over medium-low heat and cook the apples in the butter and sugar , uncovered , until the sugar turns golden brown ; this will take at least 1 hour . watch the apples closely to be sure they don't stick ; you may want to adjust the heat now and then , to slow down or speed up the cooking . as the sugar and butter melt and the apples give up some of their juices , baste the apples occasionally with a turkey baster . the apples may give up a great deal of juice , which can spatter . do not be concerned - gradually the juice will caramelize along with the sugar and will caramelize the apples nearly all the way through , though they will remain uncooked on top . <eos> preheat the oven to 425° . <eos> when the cooking juices are deep golden and the apples are nearly cooked through , remove the pastry from the refrigerator and quickly and carefully place it over the apples , gently pushing it down around them , simultaneously easing it toward the center so that if it shrinks on the sides there will still be enough of it to cover the apples . using a sharp knife , trim off and discard any extra pastry . <eos> place the skillet on a baking sheet . bake in the center of the oven until the pastry is golden , 25 to 30 minutes . don't be concerned if the juices bubble over ; the tart will be more or less juicy , depending on the variety of apple you have used . <eos> remove the skillet from the oven . immediately invert a serving platter with a slight lip over the skillet . quickly but carefully—the juices will be very hot—flip the two so the crust is on the bottom  , the apples are on top , and the juices don't run off onto the floor . remove the skillet . should any apples stick , gently remove and reinsert them into their rightful place . <eos> serve generous slices as soon as the tart has cooled slightly , but is still very warm through . <eos> place the flour and salt in a food processor and process once to mix . add the butter and process until the mixture resembles coarse meal , pulsing five to eight times . add the 5 tablespoons ice water and pulse just until the pastry begins to hold together , not more than nine to ten times . add the remaining 1 tablespoon water if the pastry seems dry  . ( to make pastry without a food processor , place the flour and salt in a bowl and work the cold butter into it using your fingers , until it resembles coarse meal . sprinkle over 5 tablespoons of water and work it in using your fingers , until the pastry begins to hold together . add the additional water if the pastry seems dry . ) <eos> transfer the pastry to a work surface and knead it gently just until it forms a ball . flatten the ball , place it on a work surface , cover it with a bowl so it <eos> Categories <eos> fruit <eos> dessert <eos> bake <eos> apple <eos> kidney friendly <eos> vegetarian <eos> pescatarian <eos> peanut free <eos> tree nut free <eos> soy free <eos> kosher <eos>

( use a clean towel that is old or you don't mind washing with bleach , because the skins tend to discolor the fabric . ) rub the nuts to remove most of the skins ( they never come completely off ) . <eos> you can substitute unsalted cashews for the hazelnuts . toast cashews , as directed above for hazelnuts , for 8 to 10 minutes until lightly browned . <eos> Categories <eos> salad <eos> mustard <eos> onion <eos> appetizer <eos> side <eos> thanksgiving <eos> vegetarian <eos> dried fruit <eos> pear <eos> spinach <eos> fall <eos> healthy <eos> hazelnut <eos> potluck <eos> vegan <eos> pescatarian <eos> dairy free <eos> wheat/gluten-free <eos> peanut free <eos> soy free <eos> kosher <eos>

collards  <eos> Ingredients <eos> 2 bunches ( about 5 pounds ) fresh collards <eos> 6 strips of bacon , diced <eos> 1 large onion , peeled and diced <eos> 1 teaspoon dried red pepper flakes <eos> 2 teaspoons salt <eos> 1 ham bone <eos> Directions <eos> remove the tougher , woody stalks from the collard leaves . smaller stems are okay . wash the leaves and cut them into half-inch-wide strips . you can roll them into cigars to speed this up . <eos> put the bacon in a stock pot on high head to render its grease , 3 or so minutes . add the onion and cook until translucent but not brown , about 5 minutes more . add the collards and cover with cool water . add the red pepper , salt , and the ham bone . bring to a boil and cook for at least 2 hours . there are many conflicting opinions on this . to my mind , collards were not made for quick cooking . undercook collards and you are asking to be strangled ; they can't be properly chewed . on the other hand , overcook them and they will eventually turn to mush . two hours seems about right , although this might give nutritionists pause . taste for salt . <eos> even people who love collards complain about the way they make the house smell while cooking . people have different cures for this : place four pecans in the pot . cover the top of the collards with slices of white bread . none of this works . <eos> Categories <eos> leafy green <eos> side <eos> christmas <eos> thanksgiving <eos> new year's day <eos> bacon <eos> collard greens <eos> sugar conscious <eos> paleo <eos> dairy free <eos> wheat/gluten-free <eos> peanut free <eos> tree nut free <eos> soy free <eos> no sugar added <eos>

aged sherry-walnut vinaigrette  <eos> Ingredients <eos> 1 shallot , peeled and minced <eos> 1 teaspoon salt <eos> 1 teaspoon dijon mustard <eos> 1/4 cup aged sherry vinegar <eos> 3 tablespoons walnut or hazelnut oil* <eos> 3/4 cup extra virgin olive oil <eos> freshly ground black pepper <eos> Directions <eos> toss the minced shallots with the salt in a bowl and let the shallots "weep" for a few minutes . this helps them flavor the vinaigrette more quickly . whisk in the mustard and sherry vinegar . slowly drizzle in the walnut oil and the olive oil . it's not important to keep this vinaigrette emulsified . if the oil and vinegar separate , just stir vigorously to recombine them before using . season with the pepper and more salt if needed . this vinaigrette will keep several weeks in the fridge . <eos> *once oil has been opened , store it in the fridge to slow down the oxidation that leads to rancidity — especially a problem for nut oils . <eos> Categories <eos> mustard <eos> no-cook <eos> quick & easy <eos> salad dressing <eos> vinegar <eos> walnut <eos> shallot <eos>

noreen kinney's irish soda bread  <eos> Ingredients <eos> 1 3/4 cups unbleached all-purpose flour <eos> 1 cup whole wheat flour or graham flour , plus more for shaping <eos> 3 tablespoons cold unsalted butter , cut into tablespoon-sized pieces <eos> 2 teaspoons baking soda <eos> 1 3/4 teaspoons salt <eos> 2 tablespoons granulated sugar <eos> 1/4 cup wheat bran <eos> 1/4 cup oat bran <eos> 1/4 cup untoasted wheat germ <eos> 2 tablespoons flaxseed <eos> 1/3 cup raw sunflower seeds <eos> 1 large egg <eos> about 1 3/4 cups buttermilk <eos> Directions <eos> adjust an oven rack to the center position and preheat the oven to 425°f . coat a heavy baking sheet with vegetable cooking spray or line it with a silicone baking pan liner or aluminum foil . <eos> in a large bowl , stir together the all-purpose flour and whole wheat flour . add the butter and work it into the dry ingredients with your fingertips until the fat particles are very fine . stir in the baking soda , salt , sugar , wheat bran , oat bran , wheat germ , flaxseed , and sunflower seeds . <eos> beat the egg lightly with a fork in a 2-cup glass measure . add enough buttermilk to come to the 2-cup line and stir with the fork to combine well . add the liquid to the dry ingredients and stir with a wooden spoon or rubber spatula until the dough gathers into a thick , wet-looking mass . <eos> sprinkle your work surface with whole wheat flour and scrape the dough onto it . dust the dough with a bit more whole wheat flour . pat the dough into a circular shape about 7 inches across and 2 inches high and transfer it to the prepared baking sheet . don't be concerned about evenness—the loaf should look rustic . make a cross-shaped indentation on top of the loaf going right to the edges . i use a plastic bench scraper and press it into the dough very gently ; don't actually cut the dough . during baking the indentation expands , giving the top of the loaf an attractive pattern . <eos> bake the bread for about 40 minutes , until it is well browned and sounds hollow when rapped on the bottom . an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of the loaf should register 195° to 200°f . cool the loaf on a wire cooling rack , and serve warm or at room temperature . cut into quarters and slice each quarter with a sharp serrated knife . delicious with butter . <eos> the loaf keeps well at room temperature , wrapped in plastic wrap , for 2 to 3 days . the entire loaf or quarters of it can also be frozen when completely cool . wrap in plastic wrap , place in heavy-duty resealable plastic bags , and freeze for up to 2 weeks . thaw completely before unwrapping . if desired , refresh the bread in a preheated 300°f oven for 10 minutes . <eos> Categories <eos> bread <eos> breakfast <eos> side <eos> bake <eos> st. patrick's day <eos> healthy <eos> vegetarian <eos> pescatarian <eos> peanut free <eos> tree nut free <eos> soy free <eos> kosher <eos>

pasta all'uovo (egg dough)  <eos> Ingredients <eos> 1 pound ( 450 grams ) sifted all-purpose flour ( farina 00 ) <eos> 5 medium or large eggs , or 4 extra-large or jumbo <eos> extra flour for dusting and adjusting <eos> Directions <eos> sift the flour onto a large wooden board . form the flour into a mound with the approximate profile of mount fuji . form your hand into a loose fist , and , with the back of the fingers , gently ream out the center of the mound until you have something that resembles a low , broad volcano with a very deep crater . italian cooks call this a fountain , fontana , for the pool of liquid in the center , but it's definitely a cone . <eos> break all the eggs into the crater one by one . pierce the yolks with a fork and begin gingerly to use the fork to incorporate them into the flour with a movement something like scrambling eggs . incorporate the liquid from the center outward . the walls of the crater will keep the liquid from running out . <eos> when the liquid has absorbed enough flour that you now have a messy , wet dough surrounded by flour , knock what's left of the volcano in toward the center and begin to knead with your hands to incorporate the rest of the flour into the dough . scrape up all the remaining flour and the dough bits and squeeze them into the dough . <eos> put all the ingredients in the container of a food processor fitted with the steel blade ( not pastry hooks or the like ) . let rip at high speed until you see crumbs forming . keep going until the dough forms a ball . you may become convinced that your dough will never form a single ball , only many little ones . in that case , give up because you risk overheating the dough . pour what you have out on the wooden board ; use your hands to form the pieces into a single loaf of dough . <eos> the biggest mistake people make , says oretta , is not using enough force . skip the gym the day you make pasta and make kneading your workout . the women of scandriglia , where oretta has her country house , recommend making fettuccine as a remedy for backache in preference to those boring exercises . on the other hand , my friend antonietta , who learned to make pasta as a child in basilicata , tells me southern men enjoy watching the undulating hips of southern women as they knead the pasta dough . if it helps to put on some music and do the maccheroni mambo as you knead , go right ahead . <eos> plant your feet firmly on the floor and the heels of your hands firmly on the dough in front of you . a dining table will usually be a more comfortable height than a kitchen counter , which may be too high . with all your strength , and leaning in with your whole body , push the dough forward hard with the heel of one hand , then with the heel of the other hand . then fold it over and continue the movement , alternating hands—or whatever works for you . you're pushing the whole piece of dough forward , so it moves on the board . <eos> after each completed movement , give the dough a quarter turn and repeat . keep this up for 30 minutes , or as long as you can stand . if you've used the food processor , 15 or 20 minutes will do . you can quit early , too , if you plan to use a rolling machine : send the dough through one extra pass for each minute of kneading saved . <eos> as you work , the dough may seem dry , but you don't want it to be wet and sticky . it needs just enough moisture to hold it together , not a drop more . if your dough is so dry that you are quite sure it will never hold together , you can add a teensy bit of water . ( it used to be quite normal to use water to save eggs , which could be sold for cash . ) your goal is a single smooth loaf of dough that is not sticky to the touch . if the flour is either very freshly ground ( hence moister ) or very old ( drier ) , you'll have to adjust by feel . when it feels just right—moist but not tacky , considerably drier than the average dog's nose—set it aside for a moment . <eos> you'll probably need to clean the board about halfway through the process . use a plastic scraper or the blunt side of a large knife to scrape up any bits that have stuck to the board . ( sharp knives may damage your nice wooden board , and their edges are dulled by scraping . ) likewise wash your hands , which are doubtless also encrusted with bits of dried dough by this time . <eos> once you have a beautifully silky loaf of dough , let it rest for 30 minutes to let the gluten develop . wrap it in foil , or just place it on the board and invert a bowl over it until you're ready . by this time , you probably need to put your feet up too . <eos> when the dough and you have rested , you can proceed to the next stage . depending on what kind of pasta you want to make , this may involve rolling and cutting to make a pasta sheet ( sfoglia ) or pulling pieces directly from the loaf of dough and shaping them by hand . <eos> Categories <eos>

pastry dough  <eos> Ingredients <eos> 1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour <eos> 3/4 stick ( 6 tablespoons ) cold unsalted butter , cut into 1/2-inch cubes <eos> 2 tablespoons cold vegetable shortening <eos> 1/4 teaspoon salt <eos> 2 to 4 tablespoons ice water <eos> special equipment : a pastry or bench scraper <eos> Directions <eos> blend together flour , butter , shortening , and salt in a bowl with your fingertips or a pastry blender ( or pulse in a food processor ) until most of the mixture resembles coarse meal with some small ( roughly pea-size ) butter lumps . drizzle evenly with 2 tablespoons ice water and gently stir with a fork ( or pulse in processor ) until incorporated . <eos> squeeze a small handful : if it doesn't hold together , add more ice water , 1 tablespoon at a time , stirring ( or pulsing ) until just incorporated , then test again .

penguin buffet's classic israeli schnitzel  <eos> Ingredients <eos> 6 boneless , skinless turkey or chicken breasts , sliced thin ( about 1 1/2 pounds ) <eos> salt and freshly ground pepper to taste <eos> 1 cup all-purpose flour <eos> 3 large eggs <eos> 2 cups fresh bread crumbs <eos> vegetable or soybean oil for deep frying <eos> 2 lemons , sliced in wedges <eos> Directions <eos> 1 . place one cutlet at a time inside a large plastic bag . with a meat mallet , pound the turkey or chicken slice as thin as possible and season well with salt and pepper . <eos> 2 . spread the flour on a flat plate . break the eggs into a pie plate and beat well . put the bread crumbs on a third plate . <eos> 3 . pour the oil into a heavy skillet to a depth of 1 inch and heat over a medium flame until almost smoking . <eos> 4 . dip each turkey or chicken breast in flour , then in egg , and then in bread crumbs . <eos> 5 . fry the schnitzels for 2 to 3 minutes on each side , until golden brown . <eos> 6 . drain the schnitzels on a plate lined with paper towel . serve immediately with lemon wedges . <eos> note : you can also bake the breaded schnitzels in a 350-degree oven for a few minutes ahead of time . then , just before serving , deep-fry quickly to crisp the outside . <eos> • this dish , a variation on veal schnitzel from central europe , is a classic example of the transformations common in israeli cooking . before israel's swamps were drained in the 1950s to irrigate the desert , there was not enough grassland to pasture cows . thus the first central european jewish settlers adapted one of their native dishes to use turkey meat , more easily raised in desert conditions . subsequent immigrants have added twists from their own backgrounds , such as yemeni jews adding the middle eastern spice blend hawayij . <eos> Categories <eos> chicken <eos> poultry <eos> turkey <eos> fry <eos> purim <eos> dinner <eos> kosher <eos> sugar conscious <eos> dairy free <eos> peanut free <eos> tree nut free <eos> soy free <eos>

tempering chocolate  <eos> Ingredients <eos> bittersweet , semisweet , milk , or white chocolate , according to recipe <eos> Directions <eos> tempering determines the final gloss , hardness , and contraction of the chocolate . when you melt chocolate , the molecules of fat separate . to put them back together , you temper it . there are a variety of ways to do it . <eos> one of the easiest ways is to place it in the microwave for 30 seconds at a time on high power until the chocolate is melted . be very careful not to overheat it . the chocolate will not look as if it has melted because it retains its shape . it should be only slightly warmer than your bottom lip . you may still see lumps in it , but don't worry ; the residual heat of the chocolate will melt them . you can also use an immersion blender to break up the lumps and start the recrystallization process . <eos> usually , the chocolate begins to set ( recrystallize ) along the side of the bowl . as it begins to crystallize , mix those crystals into the melted chocolate and they will begin the recrystallization process . i like to use a glass bowl because it retains the heat and keeps the chocolate tempered for a long time . <eos> another way to temper chocolate is called seeding . in this method , tempering is achieved by adding small pieces of unmelted chocolate to melted chocolate . the amount of unmelted chocolate to be added depends on the temperature of the melted chocolate but is usually one fourth of the total amount . i usually use an immersion blender to mix the two together . <eos> the classic way to temper chocolate is called tabliering . chocolate is melted over a hot water bath to a temperature between 88°f and 90°f ( 31°c and 32°c ) . ( white and milk chocolate are melted to a temperature approximately 2°f less , depending on the amount of milk fat they contain . ) two thirds of the melted chocolate is poured on a cold table or marble surface . the chocolate is spread out and worked with a spatula until the temperature of the chocolate is approximately 81°f ( 27°c ) . at this stage , it is thick and begins to set . this tempered chocolate is then added to the remaining one third of nontempered chocolate and mixed thoroughly until the mass in the bowl has a completely uniform temperature . if the temperature is still too high , part of the chocolate is further worked on the cold table until the correct temperature is reached . this is a lot of work , requires a lot of room , and makes a big mess . <eos> a simple method to check tempering is to apply a small quantity of chocolate to a piece of paper or to the point of a knife . if the chocolate has been tempered correctly , it will harden evenly and show a good gloss within 5 minutes . <eos> Categories <eos> chocolate <eos> christmas <eos>

lemon custard with raspberry sauce  <eos> Ingredients <eos> 1 quart whole milk <eos> 2/3 cup sugar <eos> 3 large lemons <eos> 1-inch piece cinnamon stick <eos> 6 large eggs <eos> 2 teaspoons vanilla extract <eos> 1 recipe cooked raspberry sauce <eos> eight 4-ounce ramekins or custard cups , set in a small roasting pan or any pan about 2 inches deep <eos> Directions <eos> 1 set a rack in the middle level of the oven and preheat to 300 degrees . <eos> 2 combine the milk and sugar in a medium saucepan and whisk several times to mix . bring the mixture to a boil over low to medium heat . <eos> 3 use a vegetable peeler to remove just the yellow zest from the lemons in large strips . do not include any of the white pith beneath the zest , which would impart a bitter flavor . <eos> 4 when the milk boils , remove it from the heat , add the lemon zest and cinnamon stick , and allow to steep for 5 minutes . <eos> 5 combine the eggs and vanilla in a mixing bowl and whisk well , but not so quickly that the eggs become foamy . strain the milk mixture into a lipped container , such as a 4-cup measure , to remove the strips of zest and the cinnamon stick . <eos> 6 pour the milk into the egg mixture in a thin stream , whisking constantly but not quickly to avoid creating too much foam . <eos> 7 after the milk has been added , let the mixture rest for 5 minutes , then use a ladle or large kitchen spoon to remove any foam from the surface . pour the mixture into the lipped container and fill the molds almost to the top . <eos> 8 place the pan of molds on the oven rack and immediately pour 3 to 4 cups of warm water into the pan around the molds so that the water comes about halfway up the side of each mold . if the molds fit tightly in the pan , it may be necessary to remove one temporarily to have room to pour in the water . <eos> 9 bake the custards for about an hour , or until they are completely set and no longer wobbly in the center . <eos> 10 remove the pan from the oven and place it on a rack for 10 minutes to cool . then remove the molds from the pan and cool them completely to room temperature . individually wrap each mold in plastic and chill until you intend to serve them . <eos> serve the custards in the molds or unmold them to dessert plates . to unmold , insert the point of a paring knife about 1/4 inch deep between the mold and the custard . run the knife all around the inside of the mold to loosen the top . using your fingertips , ease the top of the custard to one side , letting some air into the space you create between the custard and the mold . invert a dessert plate on the mold , then invert it again . holding both the mold and plate firmly with both hands , quickly raise and lower the stack to unmold the custard . if it does not emerge easily from the mold , repeat the motion several times . top each custard with a couple of spoonfuls of the raspberry sauce . <eos> keep refrigerated at all times . you may prepare these custards a day or two in advance , but don't keep them more than 3 days total . <eos> Categories <eos> milk/cream <eos> dessert <eos> valentine's day <eos> low/no sugar <eos> lemon <eos> chill <eos> party <eos> vegetarian <eos> pescatarian <eos> wheat/gluten-free <eos> peanut free <eos> tree nut free <eos> soy free <eos> kosher <eos>

herb gnocchi  <eos> Ingredients <eos> 1 1/2 cups water <eos> 12 tablespoons ( 6 ounces ) unsalted butter <eos> 1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon kosher salt <eos> 2 cups all-purpose flour , sifted <eos> 2 tablespoons dijon mustard <eos> 1 tablespoon chopped chervil <eos> 1 tablespoon chopped chives <eos> 1 tablespoon chopped parsley <eos> 1 tablespoon chopped tarragon <eos> 1 cup loosely packed shredded comté or emmentaler cheese <eos> 5 to 6 large eggs <eos> Directions <eos> set up a heavy-duty mixer with the paddle attachment . have all the ingredients ready before you begin cooking . <eos> combine the water , butter , and the 1 teaspoon salt in a medium saucepan and bring to a simmer over medium-high heat . reduce the heat to medium , add the flour all at once , and stir rapidly with a stiff heatproof or wooden spoon until the dough pulls away from the sides of the pan and the bottom of the pan is clean , with no dough sticking to it . the dough should be glossy and smooth but still moist . <eos> enough moisture must evaporate from the dough to allow it to absorb more fat when the eggs are added : continue to stir for about 5 minutes , adjusting the heat as necessary to prevent the dough from coloring . a thin coating will form on the bottom and sides of the pan . when enough moisture has evaporated , steam will rise from the dough and the aroma of cooked flour will be noticeable . immediately transfer the dough to the mixer bowl . add the mustard , herbs , and the 1 tablespoon salt . mix for a few seconds to incorporate the ingredients and release some of the heat , then add the cheese . with the mixer on the lowest speed , add 3 eggs , one at a time , beating until each egg is completely incorporated before adding the next one . increase the speed to medium and add another 2 eggs , one at a time , mixing well after each one . turn off the machine . lift some of the dough on a rubber spatula , then turn the spatula to let it run off : it should move down the spatula very slowly ; if it doesn't move at all or is very dry and just falls off in a clump , beat in the additional egg . <eos> place the dough in a large pastry bag fitted with a 5/8-inch plain tip and let it rest for about 30 minutes at room temperature . ( if you have only a small pastry bag , fill it with half the dough two times . ) bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a simmer . line a baking sheet with paper towels . line a second baking sheet with parchment paper . <eos> because this recipe makes such a large quantity of gnocchi , your arm may get tired : an easy way to pipe the gnocchi is to place a large inverted pot , canister , or other container that is slightly higher than the pot on the right side of the pot ( left side if you are left-handed ) and set the filled pastry bag on it so that the tip extends over the side and the container serves as a resting place for the bag . twist the end of the pastry bag to push the dough into the tip . ( from time to time , as the bag empties , you will need to twist the end again . ) as you squeeze the back of the bag with your right hand , hold a small knife in your left hand and cut off 1-inch lengths of dough , allowing the gnocchi to drop into the pot . pipe about 24 gnocchi per batch . first , the gnocchi will sink in the pot . keep the water temperature hot , but do not boil . once the gnocchi float to the top , poach them for another 1 to 2 minutes , then remove them with a slotted spoon or skimmer and drain on the paper towel–lined baking sheet . taste one to test the timing ; it may still seem slightly undercooked in the center , but it will be cooked again . repeat with the remaining dough . <eos> when all the gnocchi have drained , place them in a single layer on the parchment-lined baking sheet , cover with plastic wrap , and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes , or up to a day . or , for longer storage , place the baking sheet in the freezer . once the gnocchi have frozen solid , remove them from the baking sheet and place in a freezer bag in the freezer . before using frozen gnocchi , spread them in a single layer on a baking sheet and defrost in the refrigerator for several hours . <eos> Categories <eos> cheese <eos> herb <eos> pasta <eos> side <eos> poach <eos> dinner <eos> tarragon <eos> chive <eos> parsley <eos> sugar conscious <eos> vegetarian <eos> pescatarian <eos> peanut free <eos> tree nut free <eos> soy free <eos> no sugar added <eos> kosher <eos>

brining in a bag  <eos> Ingredients <eos> 2 turkey-sized plastic oven bags or brining bags ( see cook's note ) <eos> 1 large roasting pan <eos> 1 fresh or thawed frozen turkey ( 12 to 20 pounds ) , prepared for brining as directed above <eos> 1 recipe juniper brine <eos> Directions <eos> nest 1 plastic oven bag inside the other to create a double thickness ( see cook's note ) . place the double bag , mouth open wide and facing up , in the roasting pan . <eos> fold back the top one-third of the double bag to make a collar ( this helps keep the bags open ) . place the turkey inside the double bag . unfold the collar of the double bag and pour the brine over the bird , then add 2 cups of cold water . draw up the top of the inner bag , squeezing out as much air as possible , and secure it closed with a twist tie . do the same with the outer bag . turn the package so the turkey is breast side down in the roasting pan and refrigerate for at least 12 and up to 24 hours . turn the turkey 3 or 4 times while it is brining . <eos> remove the turkey from the brine . discard the bags , brine , and any cured herbs or spices remaining on the bird . rinse the turkey under cold water and pat dry with paper towels . place the turkey back in the roasting pan and refrigerate , unwrapped , for at least 6 hours or up to overnight . this resting period allows the skin of the turkey to dry a bit so it is crisp when roasted . the turkey is now ready to be roasted . <eos> plastic oven bags ( made by reynolds ) are found with other food storage bags at supermarkets . buy the turkey-sized bags . they are food-safe , plus they are big , strong , tear-resistant , and come with twist ties . do not use plastic garbage bags , as they are not intended for food storage . i use a double thickness of bags as a precautionary measure against leakage . for the same reason , i place the bagged turkey in a roasting pan . <eos> Categories <eos> thanksgiving <eos>

carrot, avocado, and orange salad  <eos> Ingredients <eos> 4 medium garlic cloves , smashed and peeled <eos> maldon or another flaky sea salt <eos> 1 1/2 teaspoons cumin seeds , toasted and ground <eos> 1 1/2 teaspoons coriander seeds , toasted and ground <eos> 1 to 1 1/2 teaspoons crumbled dried pequin chilies or red pepper flakes <eos> 1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil <eos> 30 or so similarly sized ( each about the size of your pointer finger ) young carrots , not peeled , 1/2 inch of the green tops left on <eos> 3 tennis-ball-sized oranges <eos> 3 ripe hass avocados , chilled <eos> 2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice <eos> a handful of small , delicate cilantro sprigs <eos> Directions <eos> preheat the oven to 400°f . <eos> pound the garlic with a healthy pinch of salt in a mortar until you have a wet , fairly smooth paste . ( you can also do this on a cutting board , chopping and mashing and chopping and mashing until you're satisfied . ) put the paste in a large mixing bowl . add the cumin , coriander , chilies , and 1/4 cup of the olive oil and stir well , then add the carrots and toss well so they're coated with the oil and spices . sprinkle on 3 healthy pinches of salt , crushing the grains with your fingers as you add them , and toss again . <eos> put the carrots in a large shallow baking dish in one layer . scrape out the extra garlic , spices , and oil from the bowl and spread evenly on top of the carrots . pour 1/4 cup water into an empty spot in the casserole ( you don't want to wash off the tasty oily stuff ) and tilt the dish so the water spreads across the bottom . <eos> cover the dish tightly with foil and put it in the oven . cook the carrots for 25 minutes . take off the foil and keep cooking until the carrots are lightly browned , and about as tender and creamy as avocado flesh , but not so soft that they threaten to fall apart , about 35 minutes more . <eos> while the carrots are roasting , segment the orange as you would a lemon . squeeze the membranes into a small bowl to release the juice . set it aside . <eos> when the carrots are done , take the dish out of the oven and let it sit until the carrots have cooled a bit but are still warm . <eos> meanwhile , take the avocados from the fridge . halve them lengthwise , remove the pits , and peel the halves . cut the flesh lengthwise into slices about the same size as the carrots—the slices should be sturdy enough that they don't break up when you toss them . <eos> put the avocado slices in a large mixing bowl and add the reserved orange juice , the lemon juice , the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil , and a healthy pinch or two of salt . toss gently and well with your hands . push the avocado to one side of the bowl . add the carrots a handful at a time , scraping and tossing them in the beautiful green liquid in the bowl before adding the next handful . make sure to scrape out and add all the garlicky spices left in the baking dish . toss it all together gently , being careful not to break the avocado slices . <eos> stack the carrots , avocado , and orange segments on a platter or in a serving bowl so they're facing this way and that . top with the cilantro and serve right away . <eos> Categories <eos> salad <eos> garlic <eos> side <eos> vegetarian <eos> lunch <eos> avocado <eos> carrot <eos> spring <eos> healthy <eos> vegan <eos> cumin <eos> pescatarian <eos> paleo <eos> dairy free <eos> wheat/gluten-free <eos> peanut free <eos> tree nut free <eos> soy free <eos> no sugar added <eos> kosher <eos>
